High-security verification code using the persistence of vision phenomenon.
通过视觉滞留效应的高安全性验证码
# How does it work?
Generate a white noise background, and overlay the verification code generated by white noise on it. The white noise of the background is randomly generated and constantly replaced, and the white noise of the verification code is static. From the perspective of the machine, this is difficult to match (whether it is a brute force algorithm or OpenCV). However, due to the visual retention effect of the human eye, people can easily see the verification code.
生成一个白噪声背景，并将白噪声生成的验证码叠加在其上。背景的白噪声是随机生成并不断替换的，而验证码的白噪声是静态的。从机器的角度来看，这很难匹配（无论是暴力破解算法还是OpenCV）。但由于人眼的视觉滞留效应，人们很容易就能看到验证码。
